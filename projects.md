## Tatort ratings analysis


## Ultrasignup waitlist notifications

Ultrasignup is a website for registring for ultrarunning events (anything longer than 42.195 km). I wrote a small script that checks one's position on an Ultrasignup waitlist. It emails an update if there has been a change. I initially wrote it for myself when I was on the waitlist for [Twisted Branch 100k](http://twistedbranchtrail.com/){:target="_blank"} in 2019.
